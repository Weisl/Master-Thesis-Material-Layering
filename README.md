# Defining Design Patterns for Pattern Based Material Layering in Real-Time Engines. 

Any complex surface can be recreated by blending or layering an arbitrary number of different less complex base materials. Material layering is becoming an increasingly popular approach in recreating real world surface complexity for video games. Many AAA games use this approach for their shading workflow (e.g., *The Witcher 3, Paragon, Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, The Order: 1886, Gears of War 4*).

## Abstract

Current resources with regard to material layering (pattern layering) do not provide information on how different layering methods affect all levels of a video game production. They focus either on rendering algorithms and implementations or on how to solve particular project specific problems.

In this work a catalog of pattern layering related design patterns is developed which describes solutions to recurring problems in a standardized form. The individual elements form a structured language of interlinked patterns including all important information of a problem within. They present how, when and why to use a certain pattern and what the consequences to be expected are. The goal is to provide better information before these decisions are made: which pattern layering method should be used and how to include it into this particular project. 

Solutions proposed in this catalog have been used in different huge video game productions. Most of them have also been evaluated and tested in the VR experience *Letzte Worte VR* (2019). In conclusion, this catalog can be used to improve information based decision making with regard to pattern layering as well as input and inspiration to create more user friendly tools.

## Comments and Critics
I spent a lot of time and energy writing this thesis. I have tried to make it understandable, logical and practical. I have also tried to meet the high scientific standards. I am not immune to mistakes and I have not always achieved these goals. Please let me know if certain parts are not clear to you and if you agree or disagree with the suggested patterns. Your feedback is most welcome.
