\chapter{Abstract}

Current resources with regard to material layering (pattern layering) do not provide information on how different layering methods affect all levels of a video game production. They focus either on rendering algorithms and implementations or on how to solve particular project specific problems.

In this work a catalog of pattern layering related design patterns is developed which describes solutions to recurring problems in a standardized form. The individual elements form a structured language of interlinked patterns including all important information of a problem within. They present how, when and why to use a certain pattern and what the consequences to be expected are. The goal is to provide better information before these decisions are made: which pattern layering method should be used and how to include it into this particular project. 

Solutions proposed in this catalog have been used in different huge video game productions. Most of them have also been evaluated and tested in the VR experience \emph{Letzte Worte} (2019). In conclusion, this catalog can be used to improve information based decision making with regard to pattern layering as well as input and inspiration to create more user friendly tools.
